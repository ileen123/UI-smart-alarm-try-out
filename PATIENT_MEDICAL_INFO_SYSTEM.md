# Enhanced Patient Medical Information System

## Overview

The hospital data system has been enhanced to permanently store and display each patient's medical information including their selected problem, risk level, tags, and organ settings.

## ‚úÖ **Enhanced Data Structure**

### **hospital-data.json Structure**

```json
{
  "patients": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "S. Groen",
      "gender": "Vrouw",
      "age": 16,
      "weight": 55,
      "medicalInfo": {
        "selectedProblem": null,
        "selectedRiskLevel": null,
        "selectedTags": [],
        "organSettings": {
          "circulatoir": { "active": false, "severity": "los", "riskLevel": "mid" },
          "respiratoir": { "active": false, "severity": "los", "riskLevel": "mid" },
          "overig": { "active": false, "severity": "los", "riskLevel": "mid" }
        },
        "lastUpdated": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üè• **Enhanced Features**

### **1. Patient Setup (index.html)**
- **Persistent Medical Data**: When a patient completes setup, their medical information is saved permanently
- **localStorage Storage**: Medical info saved as `patient_{patientId}_medicalInfo`
- **Comprehensive Data**: Includes problem, risk level, tags, organ settings, and timestamp

### **2. Bed Overview (index.html)**
- **Medical Info Display**: Bed cards now show the patient's problem and risk level
- **Enhanced Status**: Instead of generic "Alarm Instellingen", shows specific medical condition
- **Example**: "Hartfalen (high)" or "Sepsis (med)"

### **3. Discharge System**
- **Clean Slate**: When patient is discharged, their medical info is cleared
- **Fresh Start**: If readmitted, they start with a clean medical record
- **Data Privacy**: No lingering medical data after discharge

## üîÑ **Data Flow**

1. **Patient Assignment**: Patient assigned to bed (basic info only)
2. **Medical Setup**: Patient goes through setup process, selects problem/risk level
3. **Data Persistence**: Medical info saved permanently to localStorage
4. **Display Update**: Bed overview shows medical condition and risk level
5. **Discharge**: Medical info cleared, patient available for reassignment

## üìã **New Functions**

### **Patient Setup Functions**
- Enhanced confirmation dialog to save medical info with patient ID
